description: In this laboratory, you will classify single units recorded from the
  cochlear nucleus on the basis of their PST and interspike interval histogram shapes.
  The data were recorded from an anesthetized preparation in an experiment performed
  by Dr. Peter Cariani. You will be provided with a tape recording of spikes and a
  computer program that enables you to construct the histograms. You will work in
  groups for the lab, but please write separate write-ups of your results. For your
  lab write-up, please limit the text to 4 pages (excluding figures).
