description: The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to illustrate how sound stimuli
  are coded in the temporal discharge patterns of auditory-nerve fibers. The techniques
  you will be using in this lab are also applicable to neurons in the central auditory
  system and other sensory systems. One limitation of this exercise if that only techniques
  for analyzing response of single neurons are considered. A different set of techniques
  deals with how information is coded in networks of interconnected neurons.
