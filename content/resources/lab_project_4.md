description: The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to give you hands-on experience
  with a compartmental model of a neuron. Compartmental models differ from point neuron
  models such as the Kalluri and Delgutte (2003) model studied in the Cochlear Nucleus
  theme in that they explicitly represent the geometry of the neuron. In a point neuron,
  all points inside the cell are assumed to have the same electrical potential.
