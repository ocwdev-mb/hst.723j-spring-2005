Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Who should take the course?
---------------------------

Anyone interested in auditory perception and the underlying neural mechanisms. The course is required for graduate students in the [Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology Program](http://web.mit.edu/shbt/). It is also appropriate for students in Brain and Cognitive Sciences or Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with an interest in hearing. Some familiarity with peripheral mechanisms of hearing (how the ear works) and biophysics of neurons is expected.

How does the course work?
-------------------------

Much of the learning is done by **theme discussions** of scientific papers. A block of lectures provides the background for reading the papers in each theme. Students are expected to read all the theme papers, then each paper is presented orally to the class by one student, followed by a discussion. At the end of a theme discussion, students write a report summarizing what they learned from the papers. The course also includes five laboratory exercises providing hands-on experience with neurophysiological, computational, and psychophysical techniques.

Prerequisites (one or more of the following)
--------------------------------------------

HST.714: Acoustics of Speech and Hearing  
HST.721: The Peripheral Auditory System  
HST.541: Quantitative Physiology: Cells and Tissues  
9.04: Neural Basis of Vision and Audition

Course Structure
----------------

The course is organized by themes forming a coherent set of lectures, laboratory exercises and discussions of scientific papers.

### Themes

1.  Masking and frequency selectivity
2.  Cellular mechanisms in the cochlear nucleus
3.  Binaural interactions
4.  Pitch and temporal coding
5.  Neural maps and plasticity
6.  Auditory scene analysis and object formation

Assignments and Grading
-----------------------

The assignments in this class consist of 4 written theme discussion reports, 3 written laboratory reports, approximately 3 oral paper presentations, and reading of 25-30 papers. In addition, there will be a final examination. Your overall grade will be based approximately on the following:
